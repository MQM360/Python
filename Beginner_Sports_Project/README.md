INTRO:

Hello! Welcome to H-Campus Sports
The idea for this project came to mind when thinking back and talking to people who are new to campus.
Often times we do not know what the campus has to offer so id fiured I could create a website that could help alleviate some of that.
With H Sport Search you enter a sport name and the website lets you know where on campus you can play that sport! This includes
all sports team and more casually played sports. it provides a list of names to the gyms, faciities or schools that has been seen engaging with that sport.



RUNNING FILES:

These files were written using CS50's platform so implementing it should be fairly straightforward.
1. navigate to the project folder /sports
2. Check to see that the data_CSV folder and the database_db folder have their respective files in them.
3. If db file is missing and the CSV is present, open the csv_to_db.py file and run it. Make sure that folder paths are correct.
Run the csv_to_db.py file and you should have generated a db file in the respective folder.
4. If the CSV file is missing, you can create your CSV file using the following format and do step 2:

    NAME & LOCATION
    Sport Name & Facility (Gym, school, etc)

5. Now that you have your information ready open the app.py file and type flask run to the webserver - click on the link and the website should be ready to use!
6. Search for a sport.


Thank you!
